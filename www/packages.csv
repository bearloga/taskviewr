Bayesian,abn,Modelling Multivariate Data with Additive Bayesian Networks,GPL (>= 2),"Bayesian network analysis is a form of probabilistic graphical models which derives from empirical data a directed acyclic graph, DAG, describing the dependency structure between  random variables. An additive Bayesian network model consists of a form of a DAG where each node comprises a generalized linear model, GLM. Additive Bayesian network models are equivalent to Bayesian multivariate regression using graphical modelling, they generalises the usual multivariable regression, GLM, to multiple dependent variables. 'abn' provides routines to help determine optimal Bayesian network models for a given data set, where these models are used to identify statistical dependencies in messy, complex data. The additive formulation of these models is equivalent to multivariate generalised linear modelling (including mixed models with iid random effects). The usual term to describe this model selection process is structure discovery. The core functionality is concerned with model selection - determining the most robust empirical model of data from interdependent variables. Laplace approximations are used to estimate goodness of fit metrics and model parameters, and wrappers are also included to the INLA package which can be obtained from <http://www.r-inla.org>. A comprehensive set of documented case studies, numerical accuracy/quality assurance exercises, and additional documentation are available from the 'abn' website <http://r-bayesian-networks.org>.",http://r-bayesian-networks.org,"Gilles Kratzer [aut, cre] (<https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5929-8935>),

linear, robust linear, count data, survival, response times, ordinal,
zero-inflated, hurdle, and even self-defined mixture models all in a
multilevel context. Further modeling options include non-linear and

The dose range can be calculated under three extrapolation methods: linear, allometry and maturation adjustment, using pharmacokinetic (PK) data. To do this, it is assumed that target exposures are the same in both populations. The working model and prior distribution parameters of the dose-toxicity and dose-efficacy relationships can be obtained using early phase adult toxicity and efficacy data at several dose levels through 'dfped' package. Priors are used into the dose finding process through a Bayesian model selection or adaptive priors, to facilitate adjusting the amount of prior information to differences between adults and children. This calibrates the model to adjust for misspecification if the adult and paediatric data are very different. User can use his/her own Bayesian model written in Stan code through the 'dfped' package. A template of this model is proposed in the examples of the corresponding R functions in the package. Finally, in this package you can find a simulation function for one trial or for more than one trial.

thought of as multivariate GLMs. VGAMs are data-driven
VGLMs that use smoothing. The book ""Vector Generalized
Linear and Additive Models: With an Implementation in R""

the statistical framework and the package. Currently only
fixed-effects models are implemented. Many (150+) models and
distributions are estimated by maximum likelihood estimation
(MLE) or penalized MLE. The other classes are RR-VGLMs
(reduced-rank VGLMs), quadratic RR-VGLMs, reduced-rank VGAMs,
RCIMs (row-column interaction models)---these classes perform
constrained and unconstrained quadratic ordination (CQO/UQO)
models in ecology, as well as constrained additive ordination

Several PSO variants and controlling options are included to fine-tune the performance of the calibration engine to different calibration problems. An advanced sensitivity analysis function together with user-friendly plotting summaries facilitate the interpretation and assessment of the calibration results. hydroPSO is parallel-capable, to alleviate the computational burden of complex models with ""long"" execution time.

ExperimentalDesign,granova,Graphical Analysis of Variance,GPL (>= 2),"This small collection of functions provides what we call elemental graphics for display of anova
results. The term elemental derives from the fact that each function is aimed at construction of
graphical displays that afford direct visualizations of data with respect to the fundamental
questions that drive the particular anova methods. The two main functions are granova.1w
(a graphic for one way anova) and granova.2w (a corresponding graphic for two way anova). These
functions were written to display data for any number of groups, regardless of their sizes
(however, very large data sets or numbers of groups can be problematic). For these two functions
a specialized approach is used to construct data-based contrast vectors for which anova data are
displayed. The result is that the graphics use straight lines, and when appropriate flat surfaces,
to facilitate clear interpretations while being faithful to the standard effect tests in anova.
The graphic results are complementary to standard summary tables for these two basic kinds of
analysis of variance; numerical summary results of analyses are also provided as side effects.
Two additional functions are granova.ds (for comparing two dependent samples), and granova.contr
(which provides graphic displays for a priori contrasts). All functions provide relevant
numerical results to supplement the graphic displays of anova data.
The graphics based on these functions should be especially helpful for learning how the methods have
been applied to answer the question(s) posed. This means they can be
particularly helpful for students and non-statistician analysts. But these methods should be
quite generally helpful for work-a-day applications of all kinds, as they can help to identify
outliers, clusters or patterns, as well as highlight the role of non-linear transformations of data. In the case
of granova.1w and granova.ds especially, several arguments are provided to facilitate flexibility

(2011, Statistical Communications in Infectious Diseases) is implemented, with application generally to individual-randomized clinical trials with multiple active treatment groups and a shared control group, and a study endpoint that is a time-to-event endpoint subject to right-censoring. The design accounts for the issues that the efficacy of the treatment/vaccine groups may take time to accrue while the multiple treatment administrations/vaccinations are given; there is interest in assessing the durability of treatment efficacy over time; and group sequential monitoring of each treatment group for potential harm, non-efficacy/efficacy futility, and high efficacy is warranted. The design divides the trial into two stages of time periods, where each treatment is first evaluated for efficacy in the first stage of follow-up, and, if and only if it shows significant treatment efficacy in stage one, it is evaluated for longer-term durability of efficacy in stage two. The package produces plots and tables describing operating characteristics of a specified design including an unconditional power for intention-to-treat and per-protocol/as-treated analyses; trial duration; probabilities of the different possible trial monitoring outcomes (e.g., stopping early for non-efficacy); unconditional power for comparing treatment efficacies; and distributions of numbers of endpoint events occurring after the treatments/vaccinations are given, useful as input parameters for the design of studies of the association of biomarkers with a clinical outcome (surrogate endpoint problem).

fixed-effects models are implemented. Many (150+) models and
distributions are estimated by maximum likelihood estimation
(MLE) or penalized MLE. The other classes are RR-VGLMs
(reduced-rank VGLMs), quadratic RR-VGLMs, reduced-rank VGAMs,
RCIMs (row-column interaction models)---these classes perform
constrained and unconstrained quadratic ordination (CQO/UQO)

The goal of the risk parity portfolio formulation is to equalize or distribute

consider the overall volatility of the portfolio as in the mean-variance
Markowitz portfolio. In addition to the vanilla formulation, where the risk
contributions are perfectly equalized subject to no shortselling and budget
constraints, many other formulations are considered that allow for box
constraints and shortselling, as well as the inclusion of additional
objectives like the expected return and overall variance. See vignette for
a detailed documentation and comparison, with several illustrative examples.

gR,abn,Modelling Multivariate Data with Additive Bayesian Networks,GPL (>= 2),"Bayesian network analysis is a form of probabilistic graphical models which derives from empirical data a directed acyclic graph, DAG, describing the dependency structure between  random variables. An additive Bayesian network model consists of a form of a DAG where each node comprises a generalized linear model, GLM. Additive Bayesian network models are equivalent to Bayesian multivariate regression using graphical modelling, they generalises the usual multivariable regression, GLM, to multiple dependent variables. 'abn' provides routines to help determine optimal Bayesian network models for a given data set, where these models are used to identify statistical dependencies in messy, complex data. The additive formulation of these models is equivalent to multivariate generalised linear modelling (including mixed models with iid random effects). The usual term to describe this model selection process is structure discovery. The core functionality is concerned with model selection - determining the most robust empirical model of data from interdependent variables. Laplace approximations are used to estimate goodness of fit metrics and model parameters, and wrappers are also included to the INLA package which can be obtained from <http://www.r-inla.org>.

Meinshausen-Buhlmann graph estimation or the graphical lasso,

screening rule preselecting the neighborhood of each variable

analysis usually d >> n, and the computation is
memory-optimized using the sparse matrix output. We also
provide a computationally efficient approach, correlation

HighPerformanceComputing,ff,"Memory-Efficient Storage of Large Data on Disk and Fast Access
Functions",GPL-2 | file LICENSE,"The ff package provides data structures that are stored on
disk but behave (almost) as if they were in RAM by transparently
mapping only a section (pagesize) in main memory - the effective
virtual memory consumption per ff object. ff supports R's standard
atomic data types 'double', 'logical', 'raw' and 'integer' and
non-standard atomic types boolean (1 bit), quad (2 bit unsigned),
nibble (4 bit unsigned), byte (1 byte signed with NAs), ubyte (1 byte
unsigned), short (2 byte signed with NAs), ushort (2 byte unsigned),
single (4 byte float with NAs). For example 'quad' allows efficient
storage of genomic data as an 'A','T','G','C' factor. The unsigned
types support 'circular' arithmetic. There is also support for
close-to-atomic types 'factor', 'ordered', 'POSIXct', 'Date' and
custom close-to-atomic types.
ff not only has native C-support for vectors, matrices and arrays
with flexible dimorder (major column-order, major row-order and
generalizations for arrays). There is also a ffdf class not unlike
data.frames and import/export filters for csv files.
ff objects store raw data in binary flat files in native encoding,
and complement this with metadata stored in R as physical and virtual
attributes. ff objects have well-defined hybrid copying semantics,
which gives rise to certain performance improvements through
virtualization. ff objects can be stored and reopened across R
sessions. ff files can be shared by multiple ff R objects
(using different data en/de-coding schemes) in the same process
or from multiple R processes to exploit parallelism. A wide choice of
finalizer options allows to work with 'permanent' files as well as
creating/removing 'temporary' ff files completely transparent to the
user. On certain OS/Filesystem combinations, creating the ff files
works without notable delay thanks to using sparse file allocation.
Several access optimization techniques such as Hybrid Index
Preprocessing and Virtualization are implemented to achieve good
performance even with large datasets, for example virtual matrix
transpose without touching a single byte on disk. Further, to reduce
disk I/O, 'logicals' and non-standard data types get stored native and
compact on binary flat files i.e. logicals take up exactly 2 bits to
represent TRUE, FALSE and NA.
Beyond basic access functions, the ff package also provides
compatibility functions that facilitate writing code for ff and ram
objects and support for batch processing on ff objects (e.g. as.ram,
as.ff, ffapply). ff interfaces closely with functionality from package
'bit': chunked looping, fast bit operations and coercions between
different objects that can store subscript information ('bit',
'bitwhich', ff 'boolean', ri range index, hi hybrid index). This allows
to work interactively with selections of large datasets and quickly
modify selection criteria.

local machine, in parallel a set of local machines, or distributed
on a mix of local and remote machines.
Extensions to this package implement additional backends for
processing futures via compute cluster schedulers etc.
Because of its unified API, there is no need to modify any code in order
switch from sequential on the local machine to, say, distributed
processing on a remote compute cluster.
Another strength of this package is that global variables and functions
are automatically identified and exported as needed, making it

Several PSO variants and controlling options are included to fine-tune the performance of the calibration engine to different calibration problems. An advanced sensitivity analysis function together with user-friendly plotting summaries facilitate the interpretation and assessment of the calibration results. hydroPSO is parallel-capable, to alleviate the computational burden of complex models with ""long"" execution time.

Although this approach is known to be an efficient heuristic, the results of recursive
tree methods are only locally optimal, as splits are chosen to maximize homogeneity at
the next step only. An alternative way to search over the parameter space of trees is
to use global optimization methods like evolutionary algorithms. The 'evtree' package
implements an evolutionary algorithm for learning globally optimal classification and
regression trees in R. CPU and memory-intensive tasks are fully computed in C++ while
the 'partykit' package is leveraged to represent the resulting trees in R, providing

MachineLearning,frbs,Fuzzy Rule-Based Systems for Classification and Regression Tasks,GPL (>= 2) | file LICENSE,"An implementation of various learning algorithms based on fuzzy rule-based systems (FRBSs) for dealing with classification and regression tasks. Moreover, it allows to construct an FRBS model defined by human experts.
FRBSs are based on the concept of fuzzy sets, proposed by Zadeh in 1965, which aims at
representing the reasoning of human experts in a set of IF-THEN rules, to
handle real-life problems in, e.g., control, prediction and inference, data
mining, bioinformatics data processing, and robotics. FRBSs are also known
as fuzzy inference systems and fuzzy models. During the modeling of an
FRBS, there are two important steps that need to be conducted: structure
identification and parameter estimation. Nowadays, there exists a wide
variety of algorithms to generate fuzzy IF-THEN rules automatically from
numerical data, covering both steps. Approaches that have been used in the
past are, e.g., heuristic procedures, neuro-fuzzy techniques, clustering
methods, genetic algorithms, squares methods, etc. Furthermore, in this
version we provide a universal framework named 'frbsPMML', which is adopted
from the Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML), for representing FRBS
models. PMML is an XML-based language to provide a standard for describing
models produced by data mining and machine learning algorithms. Therefore,
we are allowed to export and import an FRBS model to/from 'frbsPMML'.
Finally, this package aims to implement the most widely used standard
procedures, thus offering a standard package for FRBS modeling to the R
community.",http://sci2s.ugr.es/dicits/software/FRBS,"Lala Septem Riza, Christoph Bergmeir, Francisco Herrera, and

Furthermore, it can perform robust meta-analysis, which provides protection against model-misspecifications, and limits the impact of any unknown outlying studies. In addition, the package implements two exact meta-analysis methods from synthesizing 2x2 tables with rare events (e.g., zero total event). The np.gmeta() function summarizes information obtained from multiple studies and makes inference for study-level parameters with no distributional assumption. Specifically, it can construct confidence intervals for unknown, fixed study-level parameters via confidence distribution. Furthermore, it can perform  estimation via asymptotic confidence distribution whether tie or near tie condition exist or not.

A requirement of classic meta-analysis is that the studies being aggregated are conceptually similar, and ideally, close replications. However, in many fields, there is substantial heterogeneity between studies on the same topic. Classic meta-analysis lacks the power to assess more than a handful of univariate moderators. MetaForest, by contrast, has substantial power to explore heterogeneity in meta-analysis. It can identify important moderators from a larger set of potential candidates, even with as little as 20 studies (Van Lissa, in preparation). This is an appealing quality, because many meta-analyses have small sample sizes. Moreover, MetaForest yields a measure of variable importance which can be used to identify important moderators, and offers partial prediction plots to explore the shape of the marginal relationship between moderators and effect size.",NA,Caspar J. van Lissa

technique described by Ioannidis and Trikalinos; Clin Trials.
2007;4(3):245-53.",GPL-3,"I adapted a method designed by Ioannidis and Trikalinos, which
compares the observed number of positive studies in a meta-analysis with
the expected number, if the summary measure of effect, averaged over the
individual studies, were assumed true. Excess in the observed number of
positive studies, compared to the expected, is taken as evidence of
publication bias. The observed number of positive studies, at a given level
for statistical significance, is calculated by applying Fisher's exact test
to the reported 2x2 table data of each constituent study, doubling the
Fisher one-sided P-value to make a two-sided test. The corresponding
expected number of positive studies was obtained by summing the statistical
powers of each study. The statistical power depended on a given measure of
effect which, here, was the pooled odds ratio of the meta-analysis was
used. By simulating each constituent study, with the given odds ratio, and
the same number of treated and non-treated as in the real study, the power
of the study is estimated as the proportion of simulated studies that are
positive, again by a Fisher's exact test. The simulated number of events in
the treated and untreated groups was done with binomial sampling. In the
untreated group, the binomial proportion was the percentage of actual
events reported in the study and, in the treated group, the binomial
sampling proportion was the untreated percentage multiplied by the risk
ratio which was derived from the assumed common odds ratio. The statistical
significance for judging a positive study may be varied and large
differences between expected and observed number of positive studies around
the level of 0.05 significance constitutes evidence of publication bias.
The difference between the observed and expected is tested by chi-square. A
chi-square test P-value for the difference below 0.05 is suggestive of
publication bias, however, a less stringent level of 0.1 is often used in
studies of publication bias as the number of published studies is usually
small.",NA,Simon Thornley
MetaAnalysis,puniform,Meta-Analysis Methods Correcting for Publication Bias,GPL (>= 2),"Provides meta-analysis methods that correct for

The p-uniform method as described in van Assen, van Aert, and Wicherts (2015)
<doi:10.1037/met0000025> can be used for estimating the average effect size,
testing the null hypothesis of no effect, and testing for publication bias
using only the statistically significant effect sizes of primary studies. The
second method in the package is the p-uniform* method as described in van Aert and
van Assen (2019) <doi:10.31222/osf.io/zqjr9>. This method is an extension
of the p-uniform method that allows for estimation of the average effect size
and the between-study variance in a meta-analysis, and uses both the statistically
significant and nonsignificant effect sizes. The third method in the package
is the hybrid method as described in van Aert and van Assen (2017)
<doi:10.3758/s13428-017-0967-6>. The hybrid method is a meta-analysis method
for combining an original study and replication and while taking into account
statistical significance of the  original study. The p-uniform and hybrid method
are based on the statistical theory that the distribution of p-values is
uniform conditional on the population effect size. The fourth method in the
package is the Snapshot Bayesian Hybrid Meta-Analysis Method as described in
van Aert and van Assen (2018) <doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0175302>. This method
computes posterior probabilities for four true effect sizes (no, small, medium,
and large) based on an original study and replication while taking into account
publication bias in the original study. The method can also be used for computing
the required sample size of the replication akin to power analysis in null
hypothesis significance testing. The meta-plot is a visual tool for meta-analysis
that provides information on the primary studies in the meta-analysis, the
results of the meta-analysis, and characteristics of the research on the effect
under study (van Assen and others, 2019).",NA,Robbie C.M. van Aert

sequential regression and Predictive Mean Matching (PMM) that
has been extended for unordered categorical data. The Bayesian
Bootstrap allows for generating approximately proper multiple
imputations. The second variant is also based on PMM, but the
focus is on imputing several variables at the same time. The
suggestion is to use this variant, if the missing-data pattern
resembles a data fusion situation, or any other
missing-by-design pattern, where several variables have
identical missing-data patterns. Both variants can be run as
'single imputation' versions, in case the analysis objective is
of a purely descriptive nature.",http://www.r-project.org,"Florian Meinfelder [aut, cre],

interval of uncertainty using	mathematical optimization as proposed in Calatrava
et al. (2016) <DOI:10.1007/s11192-016-1842-4>.
The Rao-Stirling diversity index is a well-established bibliometric indicator
to measure the interdisciplinarity of scientific publications. Apart from the
obligatory dataset of publications with their respective references and	a
taxonomy of disciplines that categorizes references as well as a measure of
similarity between the disciplines, the Rao-Stirling diversity index requires
a complete categorization of all references of a publication into disciplines.
Thus, it fails for a incomplete categorization; in this case, the robust
extension has to be used, which encodes the uncertainty caused by missing
bibliographic data as an uncertainty interval.

Rates may change (1) as a function of time, i.e. rate shifts at specified times or mass extinction events (likelihood implemented as LikShifts, optimization as bd.shifts.optim and visualized as bd.shifts.plot) or (2) as a function of the number of species, i.e. density-dependence (likelihood implemented as LikDD and optimization as bd.densdep.optim) or (3) extinction rate may be a function of species age (likelihood implemented as LikAge and optimization as bd.age.optim.matlab). Note that the methods take into account the whole phylogeny, in particular it accounts for the ""pull of the present"" effect. (1-3) can take into account incomplete species sampling, as long as each species has the same probability of being sampled. For a given phylogeny on higher taxa (i.e. all but one species per taxa are missing), where the number of species is known within each higher taxa, speciation and extinction rates can be estimated under model (1) (implemented within LikShifts and bd.shifts.optim with groups !=0).

When conditioning on the number of final tips, the method allows for shifts in rates and mass extinction events during the birth-death process (sim.rateshift.taxa()). The function sim.bd.age() (and sim.rateshift.taxa() without extinction) allow the speciation rate to change in a density-dependent way.

to Improve Savitzky-Golay",GPL-3,"This function takes a vector or matrix of data and smooths
the data with an improved Savitzky Golay transform. The Savitzky-Golay
method for data smoothing and differentiation calculates convolution
weights using Gram polynomials that exactly reproduce the results of
least-squares polynomial regression. Use of the Savitzky-Golay
method requires specification of both filter length and
polynomial degree to calculate convolution weights. For maximum
smoothing of statistical noise in data, polynomials with
low degrees are desirable, while a high polynomial degree
is necessary for accurate reproduction of peaks in the data.
Extension of the least-squares regression formalism with
statistical testing of additional terms of polynomial degree
to a heuristically chosen minimum for each data window leads
to an adaptive-degree polynomial filter (ADPF). Based on noise
reduction for data that consist of pure noise and on signal
reproduction for data that is purely signal, ADPF performed
nearly as well as the optimally chosen fixed-degree
Savitzky-Golay filter and outperformed sub-optimally chosen
Savitzky-Golay filters. For synthetic data consisting of noise
and signal, ADPF outperformed both optimally chosen and

governments and programmes to monitor population-level demographic, social,

subpopulations (strata) in a first stage, and then households are listed and
sampled in a second stage. In this typical two-stage design, sampled
communities are the Primary Sampling Units (PSUs) and households are the
Secondary Sampling Units (SSUs). Census data typically serve as the sample
frame from which PSUs are selected. However, if census data are outdated
inaccurate, or too geographically course, gridded population data (such as
<http://www.worldpop.org.uk>) can be used as a sample frame instead.
GridSample (<doi:10.1186/s12942-017-0098-4>) generates PSUs from
gridded population data according to user-specified complex survey design
characteristics and household sample size. In gridded population sampling,
like census sampling, PSUs are selected within each stratum using a
serpentine sampling method, and can be oversampled in urban or rural areas to
ensure a minimum sample size in each of these important sub-domains.
Furthermore, because grid cells are uniform in size and shape, gridded
population sampling allows for samples to be representative of both the
population and of space, which is not possible with a census sample frame.",NA,"Dana R. Thomson [aut] (University of Southampton),

Replacements are generated by drawing from conditional distributions fitted to the original data using parametric or classification and regression trees models. Data are synthesised via the function syn() which can be largely automated, if default settings are used, or with methods defined by the user. Optional parameters can be used to influence the disclosure risk and the analytical quality of the synthesised data. For a description of the implemented method see Nowok, Raab and Dibben (2016) <doi:10.18637/jss.v074.i11>.",NA,"Beata Nowok, Gillian M Raab, Joshua Snoke and Chris Dibben"

Rates may change (1) as a function of time, i.e. rate shifts at specified times or mass extinction events (likelihood implemented as LikShifts, optimization as bd.shifts.optim and visualized as bd.shifts.plot) or (2) as a function of the number of species, i.e. density-dependence (likelihood implemented as LikDD and optimization as bd.densdep.optim) or (3) extinction rate may be a function of species age (likelihood implemented as LikAge and optimization as bd.age.optim.matlab). Note that the methods take into account the whole phylogeny, in particular it accounts for the ""pull of the present"" effect. (1-3) can take into account incomplete species sampling, as long as each species has the same probability of being sampled. For a given phylogeny on higher taxa (i.e. all but one species per taxa are missing), where the number of species is known within each higher taxa, speciation and extinction rates can be estimated under model (1) (implemented within LikShifts and bd.shifts.optim with groups !=0). (ii) For a given phylogeny with sequentially sampled tips, e.g. a virus phylogeny, rates can be estimated under a model where rates vary across time using bdsky.stt.optim based on likelihood LikShiftsSTT (extending LikShifts and bd.shifts.optim).

When conditioning on the number of final tips, the method allows for shifts in rates and mass extinction events during the birth-death process (sim.rateshift.taxa()). The function sim.bd.age() (and sim.rateshift.taxa() without extinction) allow the speciation rate to change in a density-dependent way. The LTT plots of the simulations can be displayed using LTT.plot(), LTT.plot.gen() and LTT.average.root(). TreeSim further samples trees with n final tips from a set of trees generated by the common sampling algorithm stopping when a fixed number m>>n of tips is first reached (sim.gsa.taxa()). This latter method is appropriate for m-tip trees generated under a big class of models (details in the sim.gsa.taxa() man page). For incomplete phylogeny, the missing speciation events can be added through simulations (corsim()). (ii) sim.rateshifts.taxa() is generalized to sim.bdsky.stt() for serially sampled trees, where the trees are conditioned on either the number of sampled tips or the age. Furthermore, for a multitype-branching process with sequential sampling, trees on a fixed number of tips can be simulated using sim.bdtypes.stt.taxa().

Principle 1 determines all sensible univariate relationships in the spirit of the Markovian process. The relationship between each pair of variables, including predictors and the final outcome variable, is determined with the Markovian property that the value of the current predictor is sufficient in relating to the next level variable, i.e., the relationship is independent of the specific value of the preceding-level variables to the current predictor, given the current value. Principle 2 resembles the multiple regression principle in the way multiple predictors are considered simultaneously. Specifically, the relationship of the first-level predictors (such as Time and irradiance etc) to the outcome variable (such as, module degradation or yellowing)  is fit by a supervised additive model. Then each significant intermediate variable is taken as the new outcome variable and the other variables (except the final outcome variable) as the predictors in investigating the next-level multivariate relationship by a supervised additive model. This fitting process is continued until all sensible models are investigated.",NA,"Junheng Ma <jxm216@case.edu>, Nicholas Wheeler <nrw16@case.edu>, Yifan Xu <ethan.yifanxu@case.edu>, Wenyu Du <wxd97@case.edu>, Abdulkerim Gok <axg515@case.edu>, Jiayang Sun <jiayang.sun@case.edu>"

packages required or called by your project and scripts to a local library
exactly as they existed at the specified point in time. Only those packages
are available to your project, thereby avoiding any package updates that came
later and may have altered your results. In this way, anyone using checkpoint's
checkpoint() can ensure the reproducibility of your scripts or projects at any
time. To create the snapshot archives, once a day (at midnight UTC) Microsoft
refreshes the Austria CRAN mirror on the ""Microsoft R Archived Network""
server (<https://mran.microsoft.com/>). Immediately after completion
of the rsync mirror process, the process takes a snapshot, thus creating the
archive. Snapshot archives exist starting from 2014-09-17.",https://github.com/RevolutionAnalytics/checkpoint,Microsoft Corporation

is usually considerably faster than existing approaches and can
handle many more variables.  Unlike Amelia I and other statistically
rigorous imputation software, it virtually never crashes (but please
let us know if you find to the contrary!).  The program also
generalizes existing approaches by allowing for trends in time series
across observations within a cross-sectional unit, as well as priors
that allow experts to incorporate beliefs they have about the values
of missing cells in their data.  Amelia II also includes useful

supported by functions that can determine the smoothing parameter

validation and also by restricted maximum likelihood. For Kriging
there is an easy to use function that also estimates the correlation
scale (range parameter).  A major feature is that any covariance function
implemented in R and following a simple format can be used for
spatial prediction. There are also many useful functions for plotting

Supports spatial covariate data such as pixel images.
Contains over 2000 functions for plotting spatial data, exploratory data analysis, model-fitting, simulation, spatial sampling, model diagnostics, and formal inference.
Data types include point patterns, line segment patterns, spatial windows, pixel images, tessellations, and linear networks.
Exploratory methods include quadrat counts, K-functions and their simulation envelopes, nearest neighbour distance and empty space statistics, Fry plots, pair correlation function, kernel smoothed intensity, relative risk estimation with cross-validated bandwidth selection, mark correlation functions, segregation indices, mark dependence diagnostics, and kernel estimates of covariate effects. Formal hypothesis tests of random pattern (chi-squared, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Monte Carlo, Diggle-Cressie-Loosmore-Ford, Dao-Genton, two-stage Monte Carlo) and tests for covariate effects (Cox-Berman-Waller-Lawson, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, ANOVA) are also supported.
Parametric models can be fitted to point pattern data using the functions ppm(), kppm(), slrm(), dppm() similar to glm(). Types of models include Poisson, Gibbs and Cox point processes, Neyman-Scott cluster processes, and determinantal point processes. Models may involve dependence on covariates, inter-point interaction, cluster formation and dependence on marks. Models are fitted by maximum likelihood, logistic regression, minimum contrast, and composite likelihood methods.
A model can be fitted to a list of point patterns (replicated point pattern data) using the function mppm(). The model can include random effects and fixed effects depending on the experimental design, in addition to all the features listed above.
Fitted point process models can be simulated, automatically. Formal hypothesis tests of a fitted model are supported (likelihood ratio test, analysis of deviance, Monte Carlo tests) along with basic tools for model selection (stepwise(), AIC()) and variable selection (sdr). Tools for validating the fitted model include simulation envelopes, residuals, residual plots and Q-Q plots, leverage and influence diagnostics, partial residuals, and added variable plots.",http://www.spatstat.org,"Adrian Baddeley <Adrian.Baddeley@curtin.edu.au>,

Contains over 2000 functions for plotting spatial data, exploratory data analysis, model-fitting, simulation, spatial sampling, model diagnostics, and formal inference.
Data types include point patterns, line segment patterns, spatial windows, pixel images, tessellations, and linear networks.
Exploratory methods include quadrat counts, K-functions and their simulation envelopes, nearest neighbour distance and empty space statistics, Fry plots, pair correlation function, kernel smoothed intensity, relative risk estimation with cross-validated bandwidth selection, mark correlation functions, segregation indices, mark dependence diagnostics, and kernel estimates of covariate effects. Formal hypothesis tests of random pattern (chi-squared, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Monte Carlo, Diggle-Cressie-Loosmore-Ford, Dao-Genton, two-stage Monte Carlo) and tests for covariate effects (Cox-Berman-Waller-Lawson, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, ANOVA) are also supported.
Parametric models can be fitted to point pattern data using the functions ppm(), kppm(), slrm(), dppm() similar to glm(). Types of models include Poisson, Gibbs and Cox point processes, Neyman-Scott cluster processes, and determinantal point processes. Models may involve dependence on covariates, inter-point interaction, cluster formation and dependence on marks. Models are fitted by maximum likelihood, logistic regression, minimum contrast, and composite likelihood methods.
A model can be fitted to a list of point patterns (replicated point pattern data) using the function mppm(). The model can include random effects and fixed effects depending on the experimental design, in addition to all the features listed above.
Fitted point process models can be simulated, automatically. Formal hypothesis tests of a fitted model are supported (likelihood ratio test, analysis of deviance, Monte Carlo tests) along with basic tools for model selection (stepwise(), AIC()) and variable selection (sdr). Tools for validating the fitted model include simulation envelopes, residuals, residual plots and Q-Q plots, leverage and influence diagnostics, partial residuals, and added variable plots.",http://www.spatstat.org,"Adrian Baddeley <Adrian.Baddeley@curtin.edu.au>,

The monitoring methods focus on aberration detection in count data time

applications could just as well originate from environmetrics,
reliability engineering, econometrics, or social sciences. The package
implements many typical outbreak detection procedures such as the
(improved) Farrington algorithm, or the negative binomial GLR-CUSUM
method of Höhle and Paul (2008) <doi:10.1016/j.csda.2008.02.015>.
A novel CUSUM approach combining logistic and multinomial logistic
modeling is also included. The package contains several real-world data
sets, the ability to simulate outbreak data, and to visualize the
results of the monitoring in a temporal, spatial or spatio-temporal
fashion. A recent overview of the available monitoring procedures is
given by Salmon et al. (2016) <doi:10.18637/jss.v070.i10>.

three endemic-epidemic modeling frameworks with tools for visualization,
likelihood inference, and simulation. hhh4() estimates models for

Exploratory methods include quadrat counts, K-functions and their simulation envelopes, nearest neighbour distance and empty space statistics, Fry plots, pair correlation function, kernel smoothed intensity, relative risk estimation with cross-validated bandwidth selection, mark correlation functions, segregation indices, mark dependence diagnostics, and kernel estimates of covariate effects. Formal hypothesis tests of random pattern (chi-squared, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Monte Carlo, Diggle-Cressie-Loosmore-Ford, Dao-Genton, two-stage Monte Carlo) and tests for covariate effects (Cox-Berman-Waller-Lawson, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, ANOVA) are also supported.
Parametric models can be fitted to point pattern data using the functions ppm(), kppm(), slrm(), dppm() similar to glm(). Types of models include Poisson, Gibbs and Cox point processes, Neyman-Scott cluster processes, and determinantal point processes. Models may involve dependence on covariates, inter-point interaction, cluster formation and dependence on marks. Models are fitted by maximum likelihood, logistic regression, minimum contrast, and composite likelihood methods.
A model can be fitted to a list of point patterns (replicated point pattern data) using the function mppm(). The model can include random effects and fixed effects depending on the experimental design, in addition to all the features listed above.
Fitted point process models can be simulated, automatically. Formal hypothesis tests of a fitted model are supported (likelihood ratio test, analysis of deviance, Monte Carlo tests) along with basic tools for model selection (stepwise(), AIC()) and variable selection (sdr). Tools for validating the fitted model include simulation envelopes, residuals, residual plots and Q-Q plots, leverage and influence diagnostics, partial residuals, and added variable plots.",http://www.spatstat.org,"Adrian Baddeley <Adrian.Baddeley@curtin.edu.au>,

The 'anomalize' package enables a ""tidy"" workflow for detecting anomalies in data.
The main functions are time_decompose(), anomalize(), and time_recompose().
When combined, it's quite simple to decompose time series, detect anomalies,
and create bands separating the ""normal"" data from the anomalous data at scale (i.e. for multiple time series).
Time series decomposition is used to remove trend and seasonal components via the time_decompose() function
and methods include seasonal decomposition of time series by Loess (""stl"") and
seasonal decomposition by piecewise medians (""twitter""). The anomalize() function implements
two methods for anomaly detection of residuals including using an inner quartile range (""iqr"")
and generalized extreme studentized deviation (""gesd""). These methods are based on
those used in the 'forecast' package and the Twitter 'AnomalyDetection' package.

TimeSeries,cointReg,Parameter Estimation and Inference in a Cointegrating Regression,GPL-3,"Cointegration methods are widely used in empirical macroeconomics
and empirical finance. It is well known that in a cointegrating
regression the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator of the
parameters is super-consistent, i.e. converges at rate equal to the
sample size T. When the regressors are endogenous, the limiting
distribution of the OLS estimator is contaminated by so-called second
order bias terms, see e.g. Phillips and Hansen (1990) <DOI:10.2307/2297545>.
The presence of these bias terms renders inference difficult. Consequently,
several modifications to OLS that lead to zero mean Gaussian mixture
limiting distributions have been proposed, which in turn make
standard asymptotic inference feasible. These methods include
the fully modified OLS (FM-OLS) approach of Phillips and Hansen
(1990) <DOI:10.2307/2297545>, the dynamic OLS (D-OLS) approach of Phillips
and Loretan (1991) <DOI:10.2307/2298004>, Saikkonen (1991)
<DOI:10.1017/S0266466600004217> and Stock and Watson (1993)
<DOI:10.2307/2951763> and the new estimation approach called integrated
modified OLS (IM-OLS) of Vogelsang and Wagner (2014)
<DOI:10.1016/j.jeconom.2013.10.015>. The latter is based on an augmented
partial sum (integration) transformation of the regression model. IM-OLS is
similar in spirit to the FM- and D-OLS approaches, with the key difference
that it does not require estimation of long run variance matrices and avoids
the need to choose tuning parameters (kernels, bandwidths, lags). However,
inference does require that a long run variance be scaled out.
This package provides functions for the parameter estimation and inference
with all three modified OLS approaches. That includes the automatic
bandwidth selection approaches of Andrews (1991) <DOI:10.2307/2938229> and
of Newey and West (1994) <DOI:10.2307/2297912> as well as the calculation of

We have considered the full sample and three different methods of subsampling by blocks (non-overlapping, equally spaced and bootstrap) to estimate them. In addition, it is possible to make inference about them and know if the estimated Lyapunov exponents values are or not statistically significant.

It is a flexible tool to uncover abrupt changes (i.e., change-points), cyclic variations (e.g., seasonality), and nonlinear trends in time-series observations. BEAST not just tells when changes occur but also quantifies how likely the detected changes are true. It detects not just piecewise linear trends but also arbitrary nonlinear trends. BEAST is applicable to real-valued time series data of all kinds, be it for remote sensing, economics, climate sciences, ecology, and hydrology. Example applications include its use to identify regime shifts in ecological data, map forest disturbance and land degradation from satellite imagery, detect market trends in economic data, pinpoint anomaly and extreme events in climate data, and unravel system dynamics in biological data.

For univariate series, a non-parametric approach is available through additive nonlinear AR. Parametric modeling and testing for regime switching dynamics is available when the transition is either direct (TAR: threshold AR) or smooth (STAR: smooth transition AR, LSTAR). For multivariate series, one can estimate a range of TVAR or threshold cointegration TVECM models with two or three regimes. Tests can be conducted for TVAR as well as for TVECM (Hansen and Seo 2002 and Seo 2006).",http://github.com/MatthieuStigler/tsDyn/wiki,"Antonio Fabio Di Narzo [aut],

TimeSeries,TSEntropies,Time Series Entropies,GPL-3,"Computes various entropies of given time series. This is the initial version that includes ApEn() and SampEn() functions for calculating approximate entropy and sample entropy. Approximate entropy was proposed by S.M. Pincus in ""Approximate entropy as a measure of system complexity"", Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 88, 2297-2301 (March 1991). Sample entropy was proposed by J. S. Richman and J. R. Moorman in ""Physiological time-series analysis using approximate entropy and sample entropy"", American Journal of Physiology, Heart and Circulatory Physiology, 278, 2039-2049 (June 2000). This package also contains FastApEn() and FastSampEn() functions for calculating fast approximate entropy and fast sample entropy. These are newly designed very fast algorithms, resulting from the modification of the original algorithms. The calculated values of these entropies are not the same as the original ones, but the entropy trend of the analyzed time series determines equally reliably. Their main advantage is their speed, which is up to a thousand times higher.
