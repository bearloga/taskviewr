This [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) application was created by [Mikhail Popov](https://github.com/bearloga) to quickly browse packages and their licenses using a snapshot of task views retrieved on
2018-03-13.
*Not all packages available on CRAN are shown here, just the ones in CRAN's [Task Views](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/).*
Case insensitive regular expressions are enabled for filtering, so "r (client|wrapper)" is a valid filter on the **title** column.
Thanks to [MaÃ«lle Salmon](https://github.com/maelle) for enabling the authors field.

R packages used in the creation of this app include: [ctv](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ctv) (for getting the list of packages in each task view), [purrr](https://cran.r-project.org/package=purrr) + [dplyr](https://cran.r-project.org/package=dplyr) (for manipulating the acquired data), [crandb](https://github.com/metacran/crandb) for obtaining licensing and other details for each package, and [shiny](https://cran.r-project.org/package=shiny) + [shinythemes](https://cran.r-project.org/package=shinythemes) + [DT](https://cran.r-project.org/package=DT) for surfacing all of that data (which is [available as a CSV](https://github.com/bearloga/taskviewr/raw/master/www/packages.csv)). [Garrick Aden-Buie](https://github.com/gadenbuie) used [stringr](https://cran.r-project.org/package=stringr) to make package URLs into clickable links (thanks!). The source code is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/bearloga/taskviewr).
